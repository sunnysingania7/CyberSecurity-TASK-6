Brute force attacks are one of the simplest but most time-consuming password attack methods. In this approach, a malicious actor attempts to guess a password by trying every possible combination until the correct one is found. It relies purely on computational power and time. 

For example, if a password consists of lowercase letter and is 5 characters long, there are 26^5 (11,881,376) possible combinations. The more complex and longeer a password is (using uppercase, numbers, symbols), the harder it becomes for brute force to succeed. 

The key weakness this attack exploits is short or simple passwords. Proper defense includes long passphrases, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and account lockouts after repeated failed attempts.
