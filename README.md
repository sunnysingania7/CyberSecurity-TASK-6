# Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength. 

This report presents a structured evalution of password types and their resistance to cracking attempts, using three tools : Bitwarden, PasswordMonster, and Security.org . The goal was to understand how length, complexity, and structure influence password strength.

## Summary 
Password complexity does help, but the **length** of the password (or passphrase) has the most impact. Reused or common passwords are easily broken. MFA and password managers offer strong defenses.

## Notes 
- 15 screenshots taken for each password tested. 
- Visual strength ratings were interpreted and recorded. 
- Full summary available in 'password_strength_table.txt'.
